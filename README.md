# Bill-Splitter
A bill splitter is a tool, either an app or a feature within an app, designed to simplify the process of dividing expenses among a group of people. It helps calculate individual shares of a shared bill, taking into account factors like taxes, tips, and individual orders, and often includes options for settling payments within the app.
